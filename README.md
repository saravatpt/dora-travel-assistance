# Dora Travel Assistance Project

This project appears to be related to "Dora Dataset". The exact nature of the project is not fully clear from the existing files, but it includes JavaScript and HTML files.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following key files:

- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `app.js`: Likely contains the main JavaScript logic for the application.
- `dora-sample.html`: An HTML file, possibly a sample page or template.
- `Dora-Travel-Assistance.html`: Another HTML file, suggesting a travel assistance feature or interface.
- `package.json`: Defines project metadata and Node.js dependencies.
- `styles.css`: Contains CSS styles for the HTML files.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies (if any Python scripts are part of the project).

## Dependencies

### Node.js Dependencies (from `package.json`)

- `dotenv`: Used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Python Dependencies (from `requirements.txt`)

If this project includes Python components, their dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- `dotenv==16.5.0`

## Getting Started

(Information on how to set up and run the project should be added here. This might involve steps like cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running a specific command.)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (if `app.js` is a Node.js application or if there are npm scripts to run)

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd dora-dataset
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies (if applicable):**
    If you are using Python components of this project, install their dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory if required by the application (due to the `dotenv` dependency).
    ```
    # .env file example
    # VARIABLE_NAME=value
    ```
5.  **Run the application:**
    (Provide instructions on how to run the application, e.g., `node app.js`, or how to open the HTML files in a browser.)
    - To view the HTML files, you can typically open them directly in a web browser.
